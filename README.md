- Ternary operator or a conditional operator, is a shorthand way of writing a conditional expression.

`condition ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false`

  - The condition is evaluated first.
  - If the condition is true, the expression immediately after the ? is executed and returned as the result.
  - If the condition is false, the expression immediately after the : is executed and returned as the result.
